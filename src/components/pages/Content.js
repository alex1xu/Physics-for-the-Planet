            Ever wanted to harness the power of the wind? After all, it’s free!
            In this project, you’ll learn how to build your own wind turbine.
            Then, you’ll experiment with modifying parts of your turbine to make
            it as effective as possible. Although your turbine will be made out
            of cardboard and cork, the idea of using the force of wind to turn a
            generator shaft and produce electricity is the same one used by real
            wind turbines.

            Wind turbines capture some of the immense energy from the Earth’s
            winds to generate electricity and power our homes. Because Earth’s
            wind will never run out, it is a renewable resource and makes wind
            turbine technology a crucial part of replacing
            climate-change-inducing fossil fuels as humanity’s main energy
            source.

          What's The Science?
        </h1>
        <h2 className="paragraph__text  mission__text science__text">
          How can wind generate electricity? It all starts when the wind exerts
          a <b>force</b> on the blades. Forces cause objects to move and are
          used on an object by another object. Because the blades are angled,
          when the wind pushes on the blades the blades will move sideways,
          rotating the shaft of the <b>motor</b>.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="paragraph__text mission__text science__text">
          We are actually using a motor in reverse. Whereas a motor converts
          electrical energy to mechanical energy, we are converting the shaft’s
          rotation (mechanical energy) to a voltmeter reading (electrical
          energy). In real-world applications, we would use a <b>generator</b>{" "}
          to convert mechanical to electrical energy.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="paragraph__text mission__text science__text">
          Within the motor are magnets which create a <b>magnetic field</b>. The
          shaft that is being turned has loops of copper wire on the end inside
          the motor, and when the copper loops rotate within the magnetic field
          they cause a <b>current</b> of <b>electricity</b> (A current is a flow
          of electrons, think of it like a river). This is because the amount of
          magnetic field that is present within the loop changes as the loop
          rotates. The electricity will flow through the loops, out of the
          motor, and across the voltmeter which will show a reading because of
          this electric flow.

            Have you ever wished to harness the power of water? Water is a
            renewable resource that’s vital to human survival. Who knew it would
            be so useful for issues other than hydration? In this project, you
            will learn how to build a simple water turbine. You then modify the
            turbine, looking to increase its efficiency during further

            Climate change is one of the key issues that threaten future
            generations. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the primary
            accelerators for climate change. Specifically, it can produce soot,
            smog, and acid rain, and greatly increases carbon emissions.
            Therefore, to reduce our carbon footprint, we look toward renewable
            and cleaner energy sources. Water, in the form of hydro energy, is
            one such renewable energy source. Energy can be harnessed in dams or
            directly from rivers.

          If your weight starts moving up, congrats! Your water turbine has
          successfully harnessed energy from the faucet to raise the weight!
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, experiment with the number, shape, and angle of blades to see
          which combination raises the weight the fastest! You can look at real
          water mills for inspiration. For further exploration, try hooking up
          the turbine with a generator and a motor. See the power of wind for
          more explanation.

          How can water generate the energy needed to raise the object? The
          rushing water has both mechanical and potential energy. As gravity
          pulls it down a stream/onto our turbine, it exerts a force onto our
          turbine’s blades/spoons and turns the motor. Then, as the motor turns,
          it spins the string and raises the object.
          <br />
          <br />
          This process reverses the typical energy conversion of a motor.
          Specifically, instead of converting electricity into mechanical
          energy, we are using the mechanical energy harnessed by the spinning
          turbine and converting it into potential energy noted by the raised
          object.

            What would you do if you were stranded on an island and didn’t have
            any clean drinking water? You could purify some of the dirty water
            you can find on the island! We can use the water cycle to purify
            dirty water. Because the sun’s energy can be accessed from nearly
            anywhere, this process makes for an easy, low-cost way to clean
            water.

            In one hour 488 quintillion joules of energy from the sun enters the

            yearly energy usage. How do we harness such a vast amount of power?
            Solar Panels. This project will show one example of how solar power
            could be used. You will build a car powered only by the solar panel;
            this car will not use any batteries or other expendable forms of

            Everyday we use nonrenewable sources of energy such as fossil fuels;
            this usage leads to the acceleration of climate change in many ways.
            They emit greenhouse gasses that traps the heat in the atmosphere
            therefore, causing the planet to become warmer. This leads to
            drastic changes in the ecosystems through the butterfly effect.
            Solar energy is renewable as it is from the sun and it has a cleaner
            carbon footprint.

          You could change the gear ratios between the motor and axle to modify
          the “specialization” of your car (distance vs speed). You could change
          the radii of the wheels to manipulate the torque from the floor on the
          wheels. This could help with rough surfaces. You could change the
          style of bearings to reduce the friction on the rotation of the axle.
          In other words, make it spin more smoothly. One way could be fidget
          spinners.

          What's The Science?
        </h1>
        <h2 className="paragraph__text  mission__text science__text">
          Each atom has a nucleus made up of neutrons and protons; there are
          multiple rings around the nucleus containing the electrons that are
          spinning around the nucleus.
          <br />
          <br />
          The <b>solar cells</b> (or photovoltaic cells aka PV cells) are thin
          black layers you can see inside the solar panels; each cell has
          multiple layers of silicon and other semiconductor materials. The top
          layer (N side) is negatively charged with more electrons by adding
          special elements such as phosphorus. The bottom (P side) is dosed with
          boron elements for positive charge.
          <br />
          <br />
          This difference in charges leads to the creation of an electric field
          between the layers.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Electricity</b> is a flow of electrons. As the sunlight hits the{" "}
          <b>solar cells</b>, the electrons become “energized” and break free of
          their atoms. These electrons tend to move around randomly; however,
          the electric field causes the electrons to move towards the N side.
          This leads to a creation of a circuit. If we connect these layers with
          a conductive wire then the electrons would be flowing from N side to P
          side continuously. Now we have a circuit of electricity powered by the
          sunlight.
          <br />
          <br />
          Connecting this circuit to a <b>motor</b> will provide the electricity
          to the motor. Inside the motor, there are stationary magnets that
          create a <b>magnetic field</b> (North and South ends). Between these
          magnets is a rotor which is electromagnetic.
          <br />
        </h2>
        <img
          className="project__full__image skeleton"
          alt="cover"
          src={window.location.origin + "/Solar_Car_Diagram.png"}
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <h2 className="paragraph__text  mission__text science__text">
          Electromagnetic material is a dormant magnet that gets activated by
          electricity. When the electricity activates the rotor it creates a
          magnet that is repulsive to the current magnets causing the rotation.
          The North and South ends are determined by the electron flow.
          <br />
          <br />
          Every half turn of the rotor, the special piece called commutator
          reverses the electron flow to change the ends of the rotor magnet (N
          and S) so that it is always repulsive to the stationary magnets to
          keep up the rotations.
          <br />
          <br />
          This rotation is translated to the axle through the gears by applying
          the <b>torque</b> to the gear on the axle. The torque is a rotational
          force so applying torque means applying force that causes rotation.
          The friction between the ground and the wheel also applies torque to
          the wheels causing the rotation.

            Ever wondered why houses need to be heated or cooled? In this
            project, you’ll use windows in cardboard boxes to learn about heat

            <br />
            <br />
            Conserving energy is very important, especially since many houses
            are heated with fossil fuels such as natural gas, which contribute
            to climate change. In cold areas, houses should be built to keep
            heat inside to avoid having to repeatedly heat them.

          The original temperatures of all four bottles should be roughly the
          same, since they were all filled with water that was the same
          temperature. If the water bottle in the box without a window was the
          hottest after three hours, congratulations! This is the expected
          outcome, since any type of window allows heat to escape. The second
          hottest should be the box with a thick curtain, followed by the box
          with a thin curtain and the one with a window but no curtain, which
          should have lost the most heat.

          What's The Science?
        </h1>
        <h2 className="paragraph__text  mission__text science__text">
          How does heat travel? The main way is through conduction, when heat
          moves from a warmer area to a cooler one. If you’ve ever wondered why
          a hot drink will slowly become colder on a cold day, it’s because of
          conduction. A material known as an insulator is something that blocks
          the flow of heat, preventing conduction from occurring as quickly.
          Anything can be an insulator - from a book made of paper to a window
          made of glass. However, thicker materials such as wool are generally
          better insulators. Plastic wrap, since it’s so thin, isn’t a very
          effective insulator, so a cardboard box with a window in it made of
          plastic wrap will lose heat faster than one without.
          <br />
          <br />
          Believe it or not, the best insulator is actually a vacuum, or a space
          where there’s nothing at all, not even air! Because of that, the best
          kind of window would be one with two layers, and a vacuum in between
          them. This technique is used in insulated food containers and water
          bottles. Using this method, very little heat is lost to conduction.
          However, creating a vacuum is very hard, so it isn’t possible to make
          a window like that in a cardboard box.
          <br />
          <br />
          Scientists have estimated that homeowners can reduce their home’s
          energy bill by up to a quarter with insulated curtains to better keep
          heat inside, and even the U.S. Department of Energy says that
          homeowners should use insulated curtains to save money. Since heating
          up houses takes energy, it’s important to keep our homes as warm as
          possible using the principles of insulation and conduction.

            Climate change is a huge issue that becomes exponentially worse as
            time goes on. The burning of fossil fuels is a big part of speeding
            up this process, and it is important to learn why. Fossil fuels
            often produce Carbon Dioxide(CO2) as a leftover product, which can
            increase the greenhouse effects of the earth. This causes global
            warming, the melting of ice caps, increased natural disasters, and
            disrupted environments due to rising temperatures. Learning what
            excess carbon dioxide does to our planet is important as it brings
            awareness to how the use of fossil fuels is hurting us, and the need
            there is to stop it

          How does carbon dioxide help increase atmospheric temperatures? Carbon
          dioxide is a type of greenhouse gas, which helps contain heat within
          the earth’s atmosphere. In the beginning, the sun sends solar
          radiation (light), which ~50% entered the earth’s surface. The Earth
          then absorbs it and emits the extra heat outwards. The Earth has many
          greenhouse gases so when the infrared radiation(heat) that the Earth
          emits goes up, some of the heat reflects back, instead of escaping the
          earth. This is important in maintaining good temperatures for living
          beings, but too much greenhouse gases can capture too much heat,
          causing the Earth to warm up, and cause global warming.

          Should We Give the All-Clear for Nuclear?

        <h2 className=" italics__text blog__author__text">By Charles Huang</h2>
        <h2 className="blog__paragraph__text paragraph-break">
          Burning Fossil Fuels for energy is unsustainable. That much is known.
          But what type of energy should be used to replace it? Right now, 80%
          of the world’s energy still comes from fossil fuels!
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>"Green" Energy vs. Nuclear Energy</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Two commonly proposed alternatives are nuclear energy and “green
          energy” (sources like solar and wind power). Both "emit very little
          CO2 per unit of energy production, and are also much better than
          fossil fuels in limiting levels of local air pollution". But what do
          they do differently? What makes one better than the other?
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Consistency is Key</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Reliability and flexibility are key factors. Obviously, wind and solar
          power only work when the wind blows fast enough or when the sun isn't
          covered by clouds. (Denmark, for example, produces more than 50% of
          its energy from wind turbines). They often have to ask Norway for
          energy (around 40% of which is nuclear, according to
          world-nuclear.org) when there is not enough wind to power their
          country. Accordingly, wind and solar farms must be built in locations
          that are windy/have lots of sunlight. Nuclear energy, on the other
          hand, can run 24/7, and can be built "anywhere". (It would make sense
          to not build them in/near residential areas, obviously. But there are
          no real environmental limitations with building nuclear plants the
          same way there are with green energy power plants). In fact, wind and
          solar farms don't just need these specific locations—they need these
          specific types of locations to also have lots of space. Wind turbines
          should be placed 8-12 times their rotor diameter apart (grammar?) to
          avoid disturbing each other (turbulence). To produce the same amount
          of power, nuclear energy plants require less space than solar or wind
          counterparts.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>"We Must Make Waste!"</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          What about waste? Nuclear waste is toxic, while solar power is green,
          and therefore better for the environment, right? Well, not exactly.
          It's true that nuclear waste is toxic, but it is also, in general,
          compact and easy to store; lots of waste can be stored in a single
          small facility. It also can be reprocessed and recycled (although most
          waste is currently not [recycled]). Solar panels contain lead,
          selenium, and cadmium—toxic materials—and are dumped in landfills,
          which poses a risk for contamination of groundwater. In California
          alone, more than 1 million photovoltaic panels are soon expiring, and
          no plan exists to dispose of them safely. These disposal problems are
          compounded by the fact that solar panel lifespans are about 20-30
          years. Many nuclear power plants, on the other hand, have "permit
          lives" of 40 years, but there is "no technical limit" to them
          continuing to produce energy.

          <b>Issues With Nuclear Energy</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Of course, nuclear power plants cannot reasonably be made in cities or
          in residential areas. Solar and wind power (think—flower turbines!)
          can be placed to utilize extra spaces in cities and suburbs (like
          rooftops, for instance) to provide extra green energy where nuclear
          power cannot exist. Nuclear accidents may also occur, resulting in
          significantly more serious disasters than accidents in solar farms.
          Also, there exist serious, valid concerns about a large-scale accident
          in a nuclear plant, which could wreak devastation that wind and solar
          plants could never get close to creating. Chernobyl was caused by an
          accident—it's possible too, nowadays, that a terrorist could bomb a
          reactor to create a disaster.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Slap That Nuclear Reactor on a Boat!</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          So what's the solution? The answer may lie in nuclear power barges. If
          the reactor of a traditional nuclear reactor were to explode, the gas
          cloud it could produce would be uncontainable and would spread,
          potentially across continents. Nuclear power barges use molten salt to
          moderate reactions—if they were to explode (or be bombed), the salt
          would solidify and stay (remember, the barge is in water!) to be
          cleaned up at a later time (sooner rather than later, hopefully). Not
          only are they safer, but they are cheaper, too. Traditional land-based
          nuclear power stations require the reactor to be assembled at the
          build site. The "modular designs" of these barges allow them to be
          assembled in factories. The only shortcoming is that these barges are
          not as large as land-based nuclear reactors—they cannot power the
          world on their own. However, these boats—which could power up to 1.6
          million homes and are set to be released in as soon as 10 years—could
          provide a decent percentage of the world's energy in a safe and green
          manner.

          The Underrated Power of Flower Turbines

          The use of wind turbines as renewable energy has been a touchy topic
          in recent years.
          <br />
          <br />
          They are one of the top 10 causes of bird fatalities, as turbine
          blades spinning in the air may hit (and kill!) the occasional bird.
          Traditional wind turbines generally don't make a lot of noise, but
          that is not to say that no noise is made. They also need vast
          stretches of land to operate, as turbines placed too close to each
          other may interfere with wind patterns, slowing down the blades. And
          they need a consistently strong wind to push the rotors at an
          effective rate, too.
          <br />
          <br />
          Flower Turbines solve all of these issues.
          <br />
          <br />
          They pose no threat to our avian friends. They are aesthetic and take
          up significantly less space than traditional wind turbines (which also
          need to be really big to produce energy efficiently, unlike Flower
          Turbines). Flower Turbines, in fact, actually work better when placed
          next to each other than they do separately. They also require a much
          slower starting speed, opening up opportunities for these turbines to
          be placed in areas where traditional turbines may not work.
        </h2>
        <h2 className="blog__paragraph__text paragraph-break">
          <b>Problems With the Traditional Model</b>
          <br />
          According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind turbines
          produce "broadband noise" (a 'swishing' or 'whooshing' sound) as wind
          passes through their rotor blades. Broadband noise is not particularly
          loud, but where nearby residences are in dips or hollows sheltered by
          the wind, the noise may "carry further than on flat terrain.”
          <br />
          <br />
          They also require a distance of separation multiple times their rotor
          lengths—estimates for spacing run from 3 to 12 times the rotor
          diameter between turbines. The typical modern turbine is around 70
          meters tall with blades about 50 meters long (for a 100 meter
          diameter). This means lots and lots of space are usually required to
          use these turbines.
          <br />
          <br />
          This space not only needs to be strong enough to support the weight of
          turbines and construction equipment, but it must be in an open space
          that receives a strong, consistent wind (only a wind blowing at 3 m/s
          or more can start up a typical turbine).

          <br />
          Lastly, it's estimated that 1.17 million birds are killed by wind
          turbines in the United States yearly—this number may even be
          lowballing it, since wind facilities often require the construction of
          powerlines, which kill another 30+ million birds yearly in the U.S.
          through electrocution and collision.
          <br />
          <br />
          The unique shape and design of Flower Turbines circumvents these
          shortcomings, but how?
        </h2>
        <h2 className="blog__paragraph__text paragraph-break">
          <b>What Flower Turbines Do Differently</b>
          <br />
          Firstly, flower turbines produce less noise than traditional turbines.
          They're even reported to make less noise than the wind! They also
          don't require as much space; the design of Flower Turbines means that
          putting turbines next to each other actually generates more energy,
          not less! This is because Flower Turbines spin vertically (like a
          helicopter's main propeller blades), while traditional turbines spin
          horizontally (like the blades of a prop plane). The design allows
          Flower Turbines to push wind into neighboring turbines, artificially
          increasing wind speed.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another key aspect of the design are the horizontal ribs. These not
          only hold the segments (or “petals") together, but they reduce
          turbulence, making Flower Turbines more efficient (15-40%) than the
          other turbines out there (7-30%).
          <br />
          <br />
          Flower turbines come in a variety of sizes, including turbines with
          blades only 1m high. And compared to the 3 m/s required starting speed
          for most wind turbines, Flower Turbines only require wind speeds of
          0.7 m/s! This makes the turbines far easier to deploy than traditional
          models. Lastly, but certainly not least, Flower Turbines do not kill
          birds!

          Physics for the Planet recently held a fun-filled evening of
          competitive wind-turbine building with the Scouts of Troop 10. The
          event took place at the Company #3 Manhasset-Lakeville Firehouse,
          where the 40+ Scouts in attendance learned how to construct working
          models of wind turbines (mostly made out of common household items)

          Then, they regrouped into patrols and duked it out as teams to see who
          could generate the highest voltage with their turbines. Friendly
          rivalries ran high as the Scouts crowded around the electric fan which
          simulated wind, watching eagerly in anticipation to see if their
          meticulously-crafted turbine could beat the high score. Along the way,
          the Scouts learned to work with basic circuitry, grasped the
          mechanisms behind renewable energy technology, and developed their
          teamwork skills. “We’re excited to be delivering workshops to the
          Great Neck community,” said Physics for the Planet Founder Rick Xu.
          “It’s rare these days that youth get to engage in hands-on
          opportunities which expand their horizons in so many ways, especially
          in the realm of environmental sustainability.”
